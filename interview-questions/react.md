1️⃣ Call, Apply, Bind → Difference + Polyfill implementation
2️⃣ Flatten an Array without Array.flat()
👉 Input: [1,2,3,[4,5,6,[7,8,[10,11]]],9]
👉 Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,9]
3️⃣ Inline 5 divs in a row without flex/margin/padding (Hint: display: inline-block)
4️⃣ Find sum of numbers without a for loop (Hint: reduce() / recursion)
5️⃣ Deep Copy vs Shallow Copy — behavior & how to achieve it
6️⃣ Promise & Async/Await output puzzle
7️⃣ Find first repeating character (e.g., "success" → "c")
8️⃣ Stopwatch Implementation (Start, Stop, Reset + live timer)
9️⃣ Build a To-Do List (Vanilla JS/React) → optimize re-renders
🔟 Currying for Infinite Sum
👉 sum(10)(20)(30)() → 60
👉 sum(10)(20)(30)(40)(50)(60)() → 210
